"""Split a combined LCOV coverage report into one file per workspace package.

`bazel coverage --combined_report=lcov` emits a single merged LCOV report
covering every first-party crate. The Cargo coverage job, by contrast, emits
one report per package (`cargo llvm-cov report --package <pkg>`) and uploads
each to Codecov under its own flag so the per-service badges work. To keep that
behaviour under Bazel we split the combined report here: every LCOV record is
routed to a package by the `crates/<pkg>/` or `services/<pkg>/` segment of its
`SF:` source path (the directory basename is the Cargo package name throughout
this workspace), producing `lcov-<pkg>.info` files ready to upload with
`--flag <pkg>` (or `--flag bazel-<pkg>` in shadow mode).

Records whose source path is under neither `crates/` nor `services/` (generated
files, or external crates that slipped past the instrumentation filter) are
dropped -- they have no package flag. Test-file records (tests/, mock_*/test_*
bins) are kept; Codecov's `ignore:` rules drop them uniformly, exactly as for
the Cargo-produced reports.
