## Overview

The `qhy-camera` service is an ASCOM Alpaca **Camera** (and optional
**FilterWheel**) driver for real QHYCCD hardware. It exposes a connected QHY
camera — exposures, ROI/binning, gain/offset, cooling, readout modes — over
ASCOM Alpaca on a fixed port so the `rp` orchestrator (and any Alpaca client:
NINA, SGPro, SharpCap) can drive it like any other device.

It is the **first hardware imaging camera** in rusty-photon, complementing the
existing [`sky-survey-camera`](sky-survey-camera.md) *simulator* (which it reuses
for scaffolding) and the same-vendor [`qhy-focuser`](qhy-focuser.md) driver.

**Provenance.** The behaviour is derived from the author's standalone
[`ivonnyssen/qhyccd-alpaca`](https://github.com/ivonnyssen/qhyccd-alpaca) driver
(MIT OR Apache-2.0, same author). Rather than vendoring that ~1,350-LOC monolith,
this service is **written natively against rusty-photon conventions on top of the
published [`qhyccd-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/qhyccd-rs) crate** (the durable,
reusable FFI layer), using `qhyccd-alpaca`'s device-trait code only as the
behavioural reference. See *Delivery phasing* and
[ADR — to be written] for why.

**Requires a proprietary native SDK.** Unlike `filemonitor` /
`sky-survey-camera`, this service links a **proprietary native SDK** that must be
provisioned before it will link, so a developer without the SDK cannot build
`-p qhy-camera`. The SDK *is* cross-platform on x86 (Linux/macOS/Windows via the
install action; linux-arm64 via the Pi), so CI builds it on all GitHub-hosted
OSes — but the SDK requirement is still the dominant design constraint. See
*Native dependency & build gating*.

---

## Native dependency & build gating (the crux)

This is the single most consequential fact about this service and the reason it
is delivered in two tracks.

- The imaging path is `qhy-camera → qhyccd-rs (0.1.9) → libqhyccd-sys (0.1.4) →`
  the **proprietary QHYCCD SDK** (a closed-source static lib) **+ libusb-1.0**.
  Both `qhyccd-rs` and `libqhyccd-sys` are **vendored first-party** at
  `crates/qhyccd-rs/` (the `libqhyccd-sys` sub-crate nested inside) per
  [ADR-009](../decisions/009-vendor-qhyccd-rs.md) — we develop them in-tree and
  dual-home them to crates.io.
- `libqhyccd-sys` declares `links = "qhyccd"` and its `build.rs` emits
  `cargo:rustc-link-lib=static=qhyccd` + `dylib=usb-1.0` **unconditionally** —
  there is **no feature/cfg gate** on the link.
- **macOS link fix (now in-tree, no patch):** the *published* crates.io
  `libqhyccd-sys 0.1.4` was cut before the macOS link fix landed — on macOS its
  `build.rs` emitted only `static=qhyccd` + `dylib=c++` and **never linked
  `libusb-1.0`**, failing with `Undefined symbols … _libusb_*`. This used to be
  worked around with a `[patch.crates-io]` git override pinning `libqhyccd-sys`
  to a GitHub commit. Since [ADR-009](../decisions/009-vendor-qhyccd-rs.md)
  vendored the crate, that **patch is gone** — the fixed `build.rs` (the
  `/opt/homebrew/lib` search path + the `dylib=usb-1.0` directive) lives in the
  in-tree source at `crates/qhyccd-rs/libqhyccd-sys/build.rs`. Linux/Windows
  link directives are unchanged.
- **Consequence:** *every machine that compiles this package* — dev laptops, CI
  runners, Bazel actions — needs the QHYCCD SDK installed and discoverable, plus
  `libusb-1.0` dev headers. Not just machines with a camera attached.
- The `qhyccd-rs` **`simulation` feature** (which this service forwards as its own
  `simulation` feature) makes the build **camera-free** (it fabricates fake frames
  at runtime via `rand`/`rayon`), and — with **`QHYCCD_SKIP_NATIVE_LINK=1`** —
  **SDK-free** too: the real FFI is `cfg`'d out and `libqhyccd-sys`'s `build.rs`
  omits the link (and drops the `#[link]` attribute via the `qhyccd_skip_link`
  cfg), so a simulation build needs no QHYCCD SDK installed. This mirrors zwo-rs's
  `ZWO_SKIP_NATIVE_LINK`. *Without* that env the static `qhyccd` lib is still linked
  even under `simulation` (so a plain `--features simulation` build with the SDK
  present works unchanged). SDK-less dev builds, the `safety.yml`
  sanitizer, and the per-PR `test.yml` / `conformu.yml` jobs set the env (so they
  need no SDK); the real (non-simulation) build — `native.yml`, `scheduled.yml`,
  Bazel's real variant, the Pi nightly — leaves it unset and links `static=qhyccd`.

### Why this matters for rusty-photon specifically

The workspace is **currently 100% pure-Rust at the link layer — zero
native/system-lib dependencies**. The old `cfitsio`/`fitsio-sys` requirement was
**purged** in [ADR-001 Amendment A](../decisions/001-fits-file-support.md) (FITS
is now pure-Rust `fitsrs` via `rp-fits`). So `qhyccd-rs` **reintroduces the first
native build dependency** since that purge. It does not match an existing
precedent — it creates a new one. The doc below specifies how it is gated so it
does not break the SDK-less default build.

### Gating plan

| Concern | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| local dev (SDK required) | `qhy-camera` is a normal workspace member but **fails to link without the SDK**. The SDK is a required local-dev prerequisite — install it (CI installs it before building); `bazel build //...` then builds the package like any other. Documented in this design doc and the service README. |
| CI | **The Cargo jobs build qhy-camera SDK-free.** `test.yml` (a nightly safety net) and `conformu.yml` both build on the `--all-features` / `--features conformu` (`simulation`) path — which `cfg`s out the real FFI — and set **`QHYCCD_SKIP_NATIVE_LINK=1`** (workflow-level env), so `libqhyccd-sys`'s `build.rs` omits the link directives and **no QHYCCD SDK or libusb is provisioned** (same pattern as `safety.yml`, and as `ZWO_SKIP_NATIVE_LINK` for the zwo crates). This drops the `ivonnyssen/qhyccd-sdk-install@v3` + libusb + macOS dylib-loader steps from every Cargo leg (ubuntu / macOS / windows / coverage in `test.yml`; Linux/macOS/Windows in `conformu.yml`). The **real native link + FFI** is still exercised by: `native.yml` (provisions the SDK via the published [`ivonnyssen/qhyccd-sdk-install@v3`](https://github.com/ivonnyssen/qhyccd-sdk-install) action on Linux/macOS/Windows, nightly + on camera-crate changes), `scheduled.yml` (nightly/beta), the **Bazel** real variant (`bazel.yml`/`bazel-coverage.yml`), and the **Pi nightly** (linux-arm64, provisioned per-run via the action's sudo-free `install: env` mode → `QHYCCD_SDK_DIR`). The SDK is publicly downloadable from qhyccd.com (no secret/auth). |
| Raspberry Pi nightly runner | `pi-nightly.yml` provisions the SDK (26.06.04) **per run** with `ivonnyssen/qhyccd-sdk-install@v4` in its sudo-free **`install: env`** mode: the action extracts the SDK under the workspace and exports `QHYCCD_SDK_DIR`, which `libqhyccd-sys`'s `build.rs` reads on Linux (preferring it over `/usr/local/lib`) to link `libqhyccd.a` **statically** — no `ldconfig`, no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, nothing written to `/usr/local`. This keeps the runner intentionally **sudo-less** (public-repo safety) *and* self-healing — a new native-SDK service or SDK version bump no longer needs a manual `setup-pi-runner.sh` re-run. `setup-pi-runner.sh` therefore no longer installs the QHYCCD SDK (its `§1b` is now a pointer to this per-run flow; ZWO is still pre-provisioned there). **aarch64 confirmed available and linking** — `qhy-camera` builds on the Pi5 arm64 nightly; `libusb`/`stdc++` come from system packages already on the runner. |
| Bazel | **SDK provisioned into the Bazel actions** (no `crate.annotation` needed). `bazel.yml` (3 OSes) + `bazel-coverage.yml` (Linux) install `ivonnyssen/qhyccd-sdk-install@v3` + per-OS libusb. On **Linux** `build.rs` finds the SDK at its hard-coded `/usr/local/lib` (read-only-mounted into the sandbox); on **macOS/Windows** the SDK extracts into `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, which `.bazelrc` forwards to build actions via `build:macos`/`build:windows --action_env=GITHUB_WORKSPACE` (`--incompatible_strict_action_env` strips it otherwise). The library, binary, unit test, **`bdd`, and `conformu_integration` are ALL first-class `//...` targets that build _and run_ under Bazel** (the `bdd` suite runs in ~16 s and the full ConformU suite in ~33 s, matching Cargo — both verified locally with 0 errors / 0 issues). **Real/sim split (ADR-009 — first-party two-variant):** since `qhyccd-rs` is now a workspace member with its own [`BUILD.bazel`](../../crates/qhyccd-rs/BUILD.bazel), the SDK variant is chosen by *which library target a rule depends on* — prod targets dep on `//crates/qhyccd-rs:qhyccd-rs` (real static SDK); the sim library/binary (both `testonly`) + `bdd`/`conformu_integration` dep on `//crates/qhyccd-rs:qhyccd-rs_sim` (the `testonly`, `simulation`-feature variant, so `Sdk::new()` fabricates a pure-Rust QHY178M and no USB is enumerated). `testonly` **build-enforces** the boundary: Bazel rejects any production binary that links the simulated SDK. The qhy-camera sim targets still carry `crate_features = […, "simulation"]` so qhy-camera's own `#[cfg(feature = "simulation")]` paths compile (e.g. `--simulation-empty`). **One retained nuance:** crate_universe resolves _one_ feature set per crate and ignores a target's `crate_features`, so the `simulation` feature's optional deps (`rand`/`rayon`) only enter `@cr` if the Cargo resolution reaches `qhyccd-rs/simulation`. qhy-camera therefore keeps a test-only `qhyccd-rs = { features = ["simulation"] }` dev-dep **solely to keep rand/rayon in `@cr`** (verified by spike: dropping it → `qhyccd-rs_sim` fails with `unresolved import rand`). `resolver = "2"` keeps that dev-dep out of `cargo build`, so the production binary links the real SDK. (Aside: crate_universe still materializes an orphan `@cr` `libqhyccd-sys` because the path dep carries a `version` for publish — nothing depends on it; `qhyccd-rs` resolves the workspace-member edge.) Run `CARGO_BAZEL_REPIN=1 bazel mod tidy && bazel mod tidy` after any `Cargo.lock`/feature change (Rule 10). |

### Resolved facts (decided)

- **SDK version: 26.06.04** — keep the install action (x86/Bazel jobs on `@v3`
  system mode; the Pi nightly on `@v4` `install: env` mode), `build.rs` macOS
  dir names, and the Pi script in lockstep. **Packaging changed at 26.x:** the
  repository dir is now the version with dots stripped (`260604`), archives are
  `.tar.gz` (not `.tgz`), there is no `install.sh` (a staged `usr/lib/etc/sbin`
  tree copied into `/`), and the per-OS archives were renamed
  (`macMix`→`mac_x64`, `WinMix`→`win64`, `Arm64`→`linux_arm64`).
  `qhyccd-sdk-install@v3` picks the scheme by a `YYMMDD ≥ 260604` threshold.
  Validated on real hardware (QHY178M + 7-slot CFW, ConformU 0 errors).
- **arm64: supported and linking** on the Pi5 runner — `qhy-camera` is in the
  arm64 nightly matrix.
- **SDK distribution: public, via the published action.** *(Decision revised to
  match the reference CI.)* The QHYCCD SDK is **publicly downloadable from
  qhyccd.com** (`.../publish/SDK/260604/sdk_linux64_26.06.04.tar.gz`); the author's
  `ivonnyssen/qhyccd-sdk-install@v3` action wraps the download and caches it on
  **Linux, macOS, and Windows**. On Linux the 26.x packaging ships no `install.sh`,
  so the action copies the staged `usr/lib/etc/sbin` tree into `/`
  (→ `/usr/local/lib` + `ldconfig`); on macOS/Windows it extracts into
  `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` where `libqhyccd-sys`'s `build.rs` looks (and adds
  `sdk_win64_<ver>\x64` to `PATH` on Windows). So **no
  authenticated tier, secret, or SHA pin is needed** — the earlier
  "authenticated/internal cache tier pending the redistribution-terms question"
  plan was superseded once the reference's CI confirmed the SDK is fetched
  publicly. (A self-hosted cache could still front it for hermeticity, but is not
  required.)

### Open questions still to resolve before Track A lands

1. **`qhyccd-rs` churn.** Single-maintainer, pre-1.0 (0.1.7/0.1.8/0.1.9 all
   shipped within days). Pin exactly (`=0.1.9`) and track upstream closely.
2. **Shutter actuation API** *(resolved).* `qhyccd-rs` 0.1.9 exposes only shutter
   *presence* (`CamMechanicalShutter`), no open/close actuation. Per the E4
   degradation clause, v0 rejects all dark frames with `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`;
   shutter-actuated darks are Future Work.

**Key components**

- **`main.rs`** — plain `fn main`, parses clap args, inits `tracing`, runs under
  `ServiceRunner::new("qhy-camera").with_reload().run_with_reload(...)` per
  [`service-lifecycle.md`](../skills/service-lifecycle.md). No hand-rolled signal
  handling, no `materialize_identity` (identities are hardware-derived).
- **`lib.rs`** — `ServerBuilder` that, on `build()`, opens the SDK and
  **enumerates every connected camera** (and any CFW discovered on it),
  registering each as an ASCOM device (index 0, 1, 2, …) with its serial-derived
  UniqueID. The eager per-device connect handshake (cache CCD info, valid binning
  modes, exposure/gain/offset min-max-step) happens on `set_connected(true)`.
  Returns a `BoundServer`.
- **`camera.rs`** — `QhyCameraDevice` (one instance per discovered camera)
  implementing `Device` + `Camera` against `qhyccd-rs`. **Every blocking SDK call
  runs inside `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`** (the same blocking-bridge discipline
  the legacy serial drivers use) so the async runtime is never stalled.
- **`filterwheel.rs`** — `QhyFilterWheelDevice` (one per discovered CFW)
  implementing `Device` + `FilterWheel` (registered automatically on detection —
  no opt-in toggle, the same rule as cameras).
- **`config.rs`** — typed `Config` with parse-don't-validate newtypes.
- **`config_actions.rs`** — `ConfigurableDriver` impl + the `dispatch` the devices
  delegate to (`config.get`/`config.apply`/`config.schema`).
- **`mock.rs`** (feature `simulation`/`mock`) — the hardware-free test backend
  (the `qhyccd-rs` `simulation` camera + a tiny in-crate trait seam over the SDK
  for unit tests).

**Concurrency.** The QHY SDK is blocking C FFI and is **not** safe to call from
arbitrary threads concurrently for a single device. Device state (current ROI,
binning, gain, target temp, exposure state machine) is held under
`parking_lot::RwLock`; all SDK calls funnel through `spawn_blocking` and a single
logical owner per device.

---

## MVP scope

The MVP boundary drives BDD scenario selection (Phase 2). Grounded in what
`qhyccd-rs` / `qhyccd-alpaca` actually support today.

**In scope (v0)**

- ASCOM Camera ICameraV3 for **every enumerated QHY camera** (each registered as
  a device on the one port), 16-bit monochrome **and** one-shot-colour (Bayer)
  sensors.
- Startup enumeration registers all discovered cameras (+ CFWs when enabled);
  per-device connect/disconnect lifecycle: open → single-frame mode → init →
  16-bit transfer → cache geometry/limits.
- Sensor geometry (`CameraXSize`/`YSize`, `PixelSizeX`/`Y`) from cached CCD info.
- **Binning** — symmetric only (`CanAsymmetricBin = false`); `MaxBinX/Y` from the
  SDK's valid binning modes; ROI rescaled on bin change.
- **ROI** — `StartX/Y`/`NumX/Y` setters accept any `u32`; geometry validated at
  `StartExposure` (ConformU "Reject Bad…" semantics).
- **Exposure** — `ExposureMin/Max/Resolution` from the SDK; single-frame
  `StartExposure`; `ImageReady`/`ImageArray`/`ImageArrayVariant`; `CameraState`
  (`Idle`/`Exposing`/`Error`); `PercentCompleted` from remaining-exposure µs.
- **Abort** — `CanAbortExposure = true` via the SDK abort path.
- **Gain / Offset** — current value + `Min`/`Max` from the SDK; `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`
  when the control is unavailable on the model.
- **Readout modes** — `ReadoutMode(s)` named from the SDK; switching updates
  cached resolution.
- **Cooling** — `CoolerOn`, `CCDTemperature`, `SetCCDTemperature`, `CoolerPower`,
  `CanSetCCDTemperature`, `CanGetCoolerPower` — all gated on the `Cooler` control.
- **Sensor type** — `Monochrome` vs `RGGB`/colour + `BayerOffsetX/Y`.
- **`MaxADU`** = `(2^transfer_bits) - 1` (65535 for the 16-bit container set at
  connect), from `GetQHYCCDChipInfo`'s reported bit depth — **not**
  `OutputDataActualBits` (see the MaxADU note under "Deliberate divergences");
  `SensorName` from the device id.
- **FilterWheel** as a second ASCOM device on the same port (when present):
  `Names`, `Position` (with moving state), `set_position`, `FocusOffsets`.
- **Dark frames** — `Light = false` returns `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` on all models in
  v0 (qhyccd-rs 0.1.9 has no shutter actuation; see E4). `HasShutter` still
  reports `CamMechanicalShutter` presence.
- `config.get`/`config.apply`/`config.schema` actions; hardware-derived
  `UniqueID` (camera/CFW SDK serial); in-process reload.
- ConformU integration test driven against the `qhyccd-rs` `simulation` backend
  (SDK installed in CI, no physical camera).

**Deferred (see *Future Work*)**

- **Dark/bias frames.** v0 rejects all `Light = false` exposures with
  `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` (qhyccd-rs 0.1.9 has no shutter open/close actuation; see
  E4). Shutter-actuated darks on mechanical-shutter models (e.g. QHY600M) and a
  cap-on operator workflow for shutterless darks are deferred to Future Work.
- `StopExposure` (graceful stop) — upstream returns `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`; only
  `AbortExposure` works.
- `FastReadout` — upstream untested; ship as `CanFastReadout` reflecting the
  `Speed` control but mark untested.
- `PulseGuide` (`CanPulseGuide = false`), LiveMode, multi-frame/video.
- Per-serial connect-time tuning (gain/offset/target-temperature defaults).
- `ElectronsPerADU` / `FullWellCapacity` (upstream `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`; supply
  placeholders only if ConformU requires them).
- TLS / HTTP Basic Auth (compose `rp-tls` / `rp-auth` later).

## Configuration

The service **enumerates every connected QHY camera** (and CFW, when enabled) at
startup and registers each as an ASCOM device (camera / filter-wheel index
0, 1, 2, …) on the one port. The hardware is the source of truth — there is no
per-camera *binding* in config. Each device's UniqueID comes from its SDK serial;
config carries only optional per-serial display overrides plus a global CFW
toggle and the port.

```jsonc
{
  // Optional per-device overrides, keyed by SDK serial. A device with no
  // entry uses SDK-derived defaults (name from model+serial; CFW filter names
  // "Filter0".."FilterN"). Named `devices` (not `overrides`) to avoid colliding
  // with the config.get response's own `overrides[]` (CLI-pinned paths) field.
  "devices": {
    "QHY600M-0123456789": {
      "name": "Main Imaging",
      "description": "QHY600M @ 1000mm"
    },
    "CFW3L-SR-9876543210": {
      "filter_names": ["L", "R", "G", "B", "Ha", "OIII", "SII"]
    }
  },
  "server": {
    "port": 11121
  }
}
```

Sections:

- **devices** — Optional per-device override map keyed by **SDK serial**. Lets an
  operator give a friendly `name`/`description` to a specific camera and human
  `filter_names` to a specific CFW. Any device without an entry uses SDK-derived
  defaults. v0 does
  **not** carry per-camera connect-time tuning (gain/offset/target temperature) —
  with heterogeneous cameras those are per-serial concerns and clients set them
  over ASCOM; per-serial defaults are deferred (see *Future Work*).
- **(no CFW toggle)** — discovered CFWs are registered as FilterWheel devices
  automatically, the same way cameras are enumerated; detection (`sdk.filter_wheels()`)
  is the source of truth. Verified on hardware: unplugging the wheel drops
  `filter_wheels` from 1 → 0 with no phantom device, so no opt-in flag is needed.
- **server.port** — Listening port (**11121**, next free in the 1112x family;
  11111–11120 and 11131 are taken). One port hosts all enumerated devices. Hard
  read-only (self-lockout: a port change would make the BFF lose the devices).

### Config actions

Standard cross-driver protocol ([`config-actions.md`](config-actions.md)),
implemented generically in `rusty_photon_config::actions` + the ASCOM adapter in
[`rusty-photon-driver`](../../crates/rusty-photon-driver). `config_actions.rs`
supplies `ConfigurableDriver for QhyCameraDriver`:

- **Secrets redacted/carried forward:** none in v0 (no auth yet).
- **Locked (identity) fields:** none — UniqueIDs are hardware-derived and not
  stored in config, so there is no identity field to lock (a deliberate
  divergence from the `materialize_identity` convention; see *Device identity*).
- **Hard read-only fields:** `/server/port` (a port change would make the BFF
  lose the devices → restart-required, not a live apply).
- **Editable fields:** the `devices` map (per-serial `name` / `description` /
  `filter_names`).
- **Validation** at load (parse-don't-validate): `filter_names` entries are
  non-empty strings; `devices` keys are free-form serial strings.

`config.apply` persists atomically, returns `status:"applying"` when a field
changed, and fires the in-process reload (`main.rs` runs under
`with_reload().run_with_reload(...)`).

### Device identity (UniqueID)

ASCOM requires a globally-unique, never-changing `UniqueID`. **This service
derives the UniqueID from the camera's hardware serial** (the QHYCCD SDK id,
available from `Sdk::cameras()` at enumeration, *before* the device is opened),
and the FilterWheel's UniqueID from the CFW's SDK id — the same scheme upstream
`qhyccd-alpaca` uses.

This is a **deliberate divergence** from the rusty-photon
`materialize_identity` / minted-UUID convention used by the other six drivers,
chosen because a camera exposes a genuinely stable, globally-unique hardware
serial. The serial is a *better* ASCOM identity than a per-install minted UUID:
it is tied to the physical camera, so it survives an OS reinstall and moving the
camera between machines, and swapping the camera correctly yields a new id.

Consequences: there is **no `unique_id` field in config**, **no
`materialize_identity` call** in `main.rs`, and **no locked identity field** in
the config-actions tiers. Because the service enumerates *all* cameras, there is
no selector — every discovered camera and CFW is exposed, each carrying its own
serial-derived UniqueID, so two identical-model cameras are naturally
distinguished by their serials.

---

## Behavioral contracts

Named, testable behaviours mapping 1:1 to BDD scenarios in `tests/features/`.
ASCOM error names per [`docs/references/ascom-alpaca.md`](../references/ascom-alpaca.md).
Values are grounded in the `qhyccd-rs`-backed implementation.

### Enumeration & connection lifecycle

- **C0.** At startup `build()` enumerates all connected QHY cameras (and any CFWs
  discovered on them) and registers each as an ASCOM device with its
  serial-derived UniqueID. Zero discovered cameras is **not** a hard failure — the
  service starts with no Camera devices, logged at `warn!`; a later reload
  re-enumerates.
- **C1.** `set_connected(true)` on a device opens *that* camera, sets single-frame
  mode, readout mode 0, `init()`, 16-bit transfer, and caches CCD info, effective
  area, valid binning modes, and exposure/gain/offset/speed min-max-step. On
  success `Connected = true`.
- **C2.** `set_connected(true)` with the device's camera unreachable / SDK open
  failure returns the mapped driver error and `Connected` stays `false`.
- **C3.** `set_connected(false)` closes that device and returns `NOT_CONNECTED`
  for subsequent operations; an in-flight exposure on it is aborted.
- **C4.** Connect is per-device and independent: connecting/disconnecting one
  camera does not affect the others enumerated on the same service.

### Geometry, binning, ROI

- **G1.** `CameraXSize`/`CameraYSize`/`PixelSizeX`/`PixelSizeY` reflect the cached
  CCD info.
- **B1.** `set_bin_x`/`set_bin_y` validate against the SDK's valid binning modes
  and set symmetric binning; an unsupported bin returns `INVALID_VALUE`.
- **B2.** `CanAsymmetricBin = false`; `MaxBinX`/`MaxBinY` come from the valid
  modes (typically 1–4, up to 8).
- **B3.** A bin change rescales the cached ROI by the bin ratio.
- **R1.** `StartX/Y`/`NumX/Y` setters accept any `u32`; geometry is validated at
  `StartExposure` (R2), not at the setter.
- **R2.** `StartExposure` with `StartX + NumX > CameraXSize / BinX` (or the Y
  analogue), or `NumX/NumY = 0`, returns `INVALID_VALUE`; otherwise the ROI is
  applied to the SDK before exposing.

### Exposure

- **E1.** `StartExposure` while disconnected returns `NOT_CONNECTED`.
- **E2.** `StartExposure` while exposing returns `INVALID_OPERATION`.
- **E3.** `StartExposure` `Duration` outside `[ExposureMin, ExposureMax]` returns
  `INVALID_VALUE`.
- **E4.** `StartExposure` with `Light = false` (dark/bias) returns
  `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`. *Implementation note:* `qhyccd-rs` 0.1.9 exposes shutter
  *presence* (`CamMechanicalShutter`) but no shutter open/close *actuation* call,
  so v0 cannot capture a true dark on any model — the design's "close shutter +
  capture on shutter-equipped models" degrades (as foreseen below) to reject on
  all models. `has_shutter()` still reports presence; shutter-actuated darks move
  to Future Work. The simulated QHY178M-Simulated is shutterless.
- **E5.** A successful light `StartExposure` sets exposure µs, runs the SDK
  single-frame capture on the blocking bridge, and on completion produces an
  `ImageArray` of the binned sub-frame, `ImageReady = true`,
  `LastExposureStartTime`/`LastExposureDuration` set, `CameraState = Idle`.
- **E6.** `CameraState` is `Exposing` during capture; `PercentCompleted` is
  derived from remaining-exposure µs (clamped to ≤ 100), `100` once ready.
- **E7.** `AbortExposure` during capture cancels via the SDK abort path and leaves
  `ImageReady = false`; `CanAbortExposure = true`.
- **E8.** `StopExposure` returns `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`; `CanStopExposure = false`.
- **E9.** A mid-exposure SDK error transitions `CameraState = Error`, sets
  `last_error`, leaves `ImageReady = false`, logged at `warn!`.

### Gain / offset / readout

- **GO1.** `Gain`/`Offset` return the current SDK value, or `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` if
  the control is unavailable on the model.
- **GO2.** `set_gain`/`set_offset` validate against cached `[min, max]` and apply
  via the SDK; out-of-range returns `INVALID_VALUE`.
- **GO3.** `GainMin/Max`, `OffsetMin/Max` reflect the cached SDK min-max.
- **RM1.** `ReadoutModes` is the SDK's named mode list; `set_readout_mode`
  validates the index and updates cached resolution; an invalid index returns
  `INVALID_VALUE`.

### Cooling

- **K1.** `CanSetCCDTemperature` / `CanGetCoolerPower` are `true` iff the `Cooler`
  control is available; otherwise the related getters return `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.
- **K2.** `CCDTemperature` returns the current sensor temperature when cooling is
  supported.
- **K3.** `set_set_ccd_temperature` validates `[-273.15, 80]` and sets the target;
  `SetCCDTemperature` reads it back.
- **K4.** `CoolerOn`/`set_cooler_on` map to the SDK PWM controls; `CoolerPower`
  is the normalized PWM percent.

### Sensor type

- **ST1.** `SensorType` is `RGGB` (colour) when the colour control is present,
  else `Monochrome`; `BayerOffsetX/Y` follow the SDK's reported Bayer pattern.

### FilterWheel (when a CFW is detected)

- **FW1.** `Names` lists `filter_names` (or generated `Filter0..N`); `Position`
  returns the current slot, or the "moving" sentinel (`-1`/`None` → ASCOM moving)
  while target ≠ actual.
- **FW2.** `set_position` validates `index < filter_count` and commands the SDK;
  out-of-range returns `INVALID_VALUE`.
- **FW3.** `FocusOffsets` returns zeros per filter in v0.

## Service lifecycle (`main.rs`)

Standard shape per [`service-lifecycle.md`](../skills/service-lifecycle.md):

```rust
use rusty_photon_service_lifecycle::{ServiceResult, ServiceRunner};

fn main() -> ServiceResult {
    let args = Args::parse();
    rusty_photon_service_lifecycle::init_tracing(args.log_level);

    let config_path = rusty_photon_config::resolve_config_path("qhy-camera", args.config);
    // No materialize_identity: ASCOM UniqueIDs are derived from the camera/CFW
    // SDK serials at enumeration (see "Device identity"), not minted into config.

    ServiceRunner::new("qhy-camera")
        .with_reload()
        .run_with_reload(|shutdown, reload| async move {
            loop {
                let bound = ServerBuilder::new()
                    .with_config_source(&config_path, CliOverrides { port: args.port })
                    .with_reload_signal(reload.clone())
                    .build()
                    .await?;           // eager SDK open + enumerate/register devices
                tokio::select! {
                    r = bound.start(shutdown.cancelled()) => return r,
                    () = reload.recv() => continue,
                }
            }
        })
}
```

`info!("Service started successfully …")` only after the bind succeeds; everything
else is `debug!` (CLAUDE.md Rule 9).

## Testing

Layered per [`testing.md`](../skills/testing.md).

- **Unit** — config parse/newtype validation, ROI/binning geometry math, the
  `Camera` state machine (Idle/Exposing/Error, `ImageReady`, percent-completed),
  gain/offset range checks, cooling gating, Bayer-offset mapping — against an
  in-crate trait seam over the SDK (mockall doubles), so unit tests need **neither
  hardware nor the SDK linked** where possible.
- **BDD** (`bdd-infra::ServiceHandle`) — connection lifecycle (C1–C4), ROI/bin
  validation (R1–R2, B1–B3), exposure happy-path + error paths (E1–E9),
  gain/offset/readout (GO1–RM1), cooling (K1–K4), and FilterWheel (FW1–FW3 when
  enabled), driven against the `qhyccd-rs` `simulation` backend.
- **ConformU** (`tests/conformu_integration.rs`, gated by the `conformu` feature)
  — launches the production binary (built `--features conformu`, which pulls in
  `simulation`) via `bdd_infra::ServiceHandle::try_start` and drives the official
  validator with `bdd_infra::run_conformu("camera", …)` and
  `run_conformu("filterwheel", …)` over HTTP. *Implementation note:* this matches
  the `sky-survey-camera` / `dsd-fp2` ConformU shape (launch the real binary),
  not a `run_conformu_tests::<dyn Camera>()` generic. `CONFORMU_PATH` unset ⇒ the
  run is skipped (so the test passes without ConformU installed); CI sets it.

> **CI caveat (critical):** the `simulation` feature removes the *camera*
> requirement; on its own it does **not** remove the SDK link (`static=qhyccd` is
> still linked). To build/test/ConformU **SDK-free**, a job must *also* set
> **`QHYCCD_SKIP_NATIVE_LINK=1`** — which is only safe when the `simulation`
> feature is active (it `cfg`s out the real FFI so no SDK symbols are referenced).
> The per-PR `test.yml` / `conformu.yml` / `safety.yml` jobs do exactly this (sim
> feature + skip env) and provision **no SDK**. Jobs that build the **real**
> (non-simulation) path — `native.yml`, `scheduled.yml`, Bazel's real variant, the
> Pi nightly — leave the env unset and must install the SDK first (see *Gating
> plan*).

## Delivery phasing (E→C)

This service is built in two tracks to isolate the genuinely novel risk (the
proprietary system dependency) from the mechanical-but-large risk (the device
driver itself).

- **Phase 0 — decision gate** *(done)*. First-class managed device confirmed;
  enumerate-all device model; SDK pinned to **25.09.29**; arm64 confirmed.
- **Phase 1 — `ascom-alpaca` branch reconcile.** Land
  `fix/macos-trait-recursion-overflow` onto `integration` and repin upstream
  `qhyccd-alpaca` to `integration`, giving the fork one shared branch (fork
  hygiene — chosen even though it is not a compile-time prerequisite for this
  service under Option C, since `qhyccd-rs` carries no `ascom-alpaca` dep). A
  separate-repo operation on the `ascom-alpaca-rs` fork.
- **Phase 2 — Track A: isolate the system-dep risk.** Add `qhyccd-rs = "=0.1.9"`
  to `[workspace.dependencies]`. Stand up SDK (25.09.29) + `libusb` provisioning
  (CI step, `setup-pi-runner.sh` incl. arm64, Bazel `requires-cargo` tag, repin
  twice). Create a **bare `qhy-camera` exposing an ASCOM Camera in `simulation`
  mode on :11121** — proving build/link, CI, Pi5 arm64, and repin end-to-end
  **before** any device-trait work. *If the Bazel sys-crate path proves
  intractable, fall back to the `requires-cargo` carve-out (Cargo remains
  canonical); the camera still builds and runs under Cargo.*
- **Phase 3 — this design doc** *(done)* + the `docs/workspace.md` row.
- **Phase 4 — Track B: full driver (Option C, confirmed)** *(done)*. Implemented
  `Device + Camera` **and `+ FilterWheel`** natively against `qhyccd-rs`, using
  `qhyccd-alpaca`'s `main.rs` as the behavioural spec only (no vendored fork); a
  thin in-crate SDK seam (`backend.rs`) wraps the blocking `qhyccd-rs` handles so
  the device logic is unit-testable without hardware. Lifecycle, hardware-derived
  identity, and config-actions wired.
- **Phase 5 — test + gate** *(done)*. 8 BDD feature suites (56 scenarios) + unit
  tests green against the `simulation` backend; ConformU wired (skips without
  `CONFORMU_PATH`); `bazel build //...` + `bazel test //...` + `cargo fmt` + clippy
  green.
- **Phase 6 — consumer + Bazel finish** *(Bazel done; consumer pending)*. CI/Pi
  SDK provisioning landed. The `bdd` + `conformu_integration` Bazel targets are
  now **first-class** (no `requires-cargo`): they depend on the `testonly`
  simulated library `//crates/qhyccd-rs:qhyccd-rs_sim`, so they no longer call
  the real `InitQHYCCDResource` (see the Gating plan's Bazel row + ADR-009's
  first-party two-variant). Still pending: the `rp`
  `CameraConfig { alpaca_url: http://localhost:11121, device_number }` consumer.

## Implementation notes (v0 deviations from the original design)

Behaviour the implementation pins down or diverges from the design above. The
behavioural contracts and the BDD feature files remain the authority; these are
the "how" decisions made while building.

- **SDK seam (`backend.rs`).** The device structs hold an `Arc<dyn CameraHandle>`
  / `Arc<dyn FilterWheelHandle>` over a thin trait that wraps the blocking
  `qhyccd-rs` handles and collapses its `eyre::Report` into one typed error. A
  production wrapper drives the real SDK; a test mock lets the unit tests — incl.
  the E9 `Error`-state path and colour/shutter models the mono sim can't show —
  run with no hardware and no *real* SDK calls. (The static `qhyccd` lib is still
  linked into the test binary — that link is unconditional, see above; only the
  runtime seam is mocked.)
- **MaxADU.** `2^bits − 1` where `bits` is the **transfer-container depth** from
  the cached `ccd_info.bits_per_pixel` (16 ⇒ 65535), defaulting to 16 if unset.
  It is **not** `OutputDataActualBits`: the driver sets a 16-bit container at
  connect (`set_transfer_bit_16`) and the SDK left-shifts each raw sensor reading
  to fill it (zero-padding the low bits — SDK manual §14), so a client receives
  values up to the container max regardless of the sensor's native ADC depth.
  Confirmed on hardware: the 12-bit IMX290 returns values quantised in steps of 16
  up to 0xFFF0, and `OutputDataActualBits` reads 14 (IMX178) / 12 (IMX290) / **0**
  (QHY5III715C) — the last of which made the old `2^OutputDataActualBits − 1`
  formula yield `MaxADU = 0` (ConformU: "below minimum"). The container-depth
  formula is uniform across all models and never 0.
- **Dark frames** → `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` on all models (E4) — no shutter actuation
  in `qhyccd-rs` 0.1.9.
- **FilterWheel `UniqueID`** is `CFW-<sdk-id>` (prefixed), because a `qhyccd-rs`
  `FilterWheel` delegates `id()` to its underlying camera and would otherwise
  collide with the camera's `UniqueID` on single-handle models.
- **Empty simulation backend** (the C0 zero-camera scenario) is selected by a
  hidden, `simulation`-feature-gated `--simulation-empty` CLI flag that makes
  `build()` use `Sdk::new_simulated()` (empty) instead of `Sdk::new()`.
- **Transport.** v0 serves with plain `axum::serve` on `server.port` (config
  carries only the port; `discovery_port` is disabled), like `sky-survey-camera`.
  The listener is created via the shared `rp_tls::server::bind_dual_stack_tokio`
  helper (IPv6 + IPv4, `SO_REUSEADDR`) like every other Alpaca service, so the
  in-process `with_reload` rebind survives a prior listener's lingering
  `TIME_WAIT`. TLS termination / Basic Auth (the rest of `rp-tls` / `rp-auth`)
  are still Future Work.
- **SDK call serialization.** The single in-flight capture is the one logical
  owner of the device's blocking SDK calls: `start_exposure` claims an
  `exposure_in_flight` slot via CAS, and `cancel_exposure` (abort/disconnect)
  bumps a generation + signals the SDK cancel but does **not** clear the slot —
  the capture task clears it only after its blocking chain has fully drained, so
  a new exposure cannot start and race the still-running SDK calls. A short
  `result_lock` makes the task's "check generation + commit result" atomic
  against an abort, so a just-completing capture can never resurrect an aborted
  frame. **`disconnect` additionally waits (bounded, ~3 s) for `exposure_in_flight`
  to clear after aborting, before closing the handle** — the capture task is
  detached (`tokio::spawn`), so closing the handle while it is still inside a
  blocking FFI/libusb call would free the handle under a live USB transfer (a
  use-after-free that trips libusb's `usbi_mutex_lock` assertion and can corrupt
  the SDK's shared libusb context). `abort_exposure_and_readout` makes the drain
  near-instant in practice. The drain is **event-driven on a deadline, not a
  polling sleep**: the capture task fires a `tokio::sync::Notify`
  (`exposure_drained`) the instant it clears the flag, and `disconnect` awaits it
  under a single `tokio::time::timeout` (canonical `Notified` `enable()`-before-
  check pattern, so a drain landing between the check and the await is never
  lost). Earlier this was a `loop { sleep(5 ms) }` busy-wait, replaced because
  repeated short sleeps can stall under scheduler pressure.
- **Camera + CFW share one physical handle — refcounted shared connection.**
  `qhyccd-rs` derives the CFW from the *same* camera id as the enumerated camera
  (a QHY CFW is driven over the camera's USB, not a separate device). The SDK
  keys the open device by id, so opening that id as two independent handles and
  closing either one tears down the shared physical device and breaks the other.
  This was **confirmed on real hardware (QHY178M + 7-slot CFW, 2026-06-18):**
  disconnecting the CFW made the next camera `StartExposure` fail with
  `SetRoiError` (QHYCCD_ERROR), and disconnecting the camera made CFW `Position`
  fail with `INVALID_OPERATION` — and in both cases the still-"connected" device's
  `is_open()` kept (mis)reporting `true`. The Camera and FilterWheel devices
  therefore share ONE
  [`SharedCameraConnection`](../../services/qhy-camera/src/backend.rs): one
  `qhyccd-rs::Camera` (the CFW operates a clone that shares the same internal
  handle `Arc`) behind a refcount of logical connections — the physical
  `OpenQHYCCD` runs on the first device's connect and `CloseQHYCCD` only on the
  last device's disconnect, while each device keeps its own logical `connected`
  flag so its ASCOM `Connected` reflects that device, not the shared handle.
  Validated end-to-end on hardware (disconnect-CFW-then-expose and
  disconnect-camera-then-move-CFW both succeed) plus unit tests over the
  simulation backend (`backend::conn_tests`). *This supersedes the v0 plan, which
  used independent handles "as the reference `qhyccd-alpaca` does" and deferred
  the refcount as Future Work pending hardware.*
- **Cooling model.** `set_cooler_on(true)` engages a nominal 1% *manual* PWM
  (matching the reference), which on real hardware is distinct from the automatic
  target-temperature regulation `SetCCDTemperature` drives. Unifying the two
  (re-asserting the stored target on `CoolerOn = true`) is Future Work.

## Future Work

- **Dark/bias frames** — v0 rejects all darks (`NOT_IMPLEMENTED`) because
  `qhyccd-rs` 0.1.9 exposes no shutter actuation. Add shutter open/close support
  (plus a cap-on / explicit-override workflow for shutterless models, e.g. the
  5III series) so `calibrator-flats` darks/bias work.
- **`StopExposure`** (graceful stop with readout) — currently `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.
- **FastReadout** validation on real hardware.
- **PulseGuide** / `CanPulseGuide`.
- **Focuser consolidation.** `qhyccd-rs` also covers QHY focusers; a future
  evaluation could let this SDK supersede the serial [`qhy-focuser`](qhy-focuser.md).
- **TLS / Basic Auth** via `rp-tls` / `rp-auth`.
- **`ElectronsPerADU` / `FullWellCapacity`** real values if a signal model is
  added.

## Packaging

Packaged as `rusty-photon-qhy-camera` (`.deb`/`.rpm`) per
[ADR-012](../decisions/012-service-packaging-architecture.md) /
[ADR-013](../decisions/013-native-sdk-payload-policy.md) and
[`docs/plans/service-packaging.md`](../plans/service-packaging.md):
binary at `/usr/bin/rusty-photon-qhy-camera`, hardened
`rusty-photon-qhy-camera.service` (camera class: `plugdev` +
`AF_NETLINK`, no `PrivateDevices`/`MemoryDenyWriteExecute`), and a udev
rule `90-rusty-photon-qhy.rules` granting `plugdev` members access to
enumerated QHY cameras (VID `1618`).

QHYCCD's proprietary firmware is **never** bundled. After installing the
package, run `/usr/sbin/rusty-photon-qhy-firmware-install` once as root:
it downloads the sha256-pinned SDK archive from qhyccd.com and installs
the camera firmware (`/lib/firmware/qhy`), the SDK's firmware-upload udev
rules, and QHYCCD's FX2/FX3-capable `fxload` (`/usr/local/sbin`) — on
Linux a cold-plugged camera receives firmware via udev + fxload as root,
not in-process, so all three pieces are required for a factory-fresh
camera to enumerate.
