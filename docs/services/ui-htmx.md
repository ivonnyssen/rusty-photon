# ui-htmx Service (web BFF)

## Overview

`ui-htmx` is the browser-facing, **server-rendered configuration UI** for
rusty-photon — the first concrete slice of the web UI described in
[`docs/plans/ui-design/config-actions.md`](../plans/ui-design/config-actions.md)
and the chosen visual direction in
[`docs/plans/ui-design/mocks/README.md`](../plans/ui-design/mocks/README.md). It
is a **standalone backend-for-frontend (BFF)**: a client of the rest of the
system that holds no UI logic inside `rp` (`rp.md` tenet 7). The service renders
HTML on the server with [axum] + [Maud] and adds interactivity with [HTMX]; there
is no npm, no WASM, no client-side framework.

The Phase 2 deliverable is a **working configuration page for the `dsd-fp2`
driver**: read the driver's current configuration, edit it in a hand-built form,
and apply changes — all by calling the driver's own `config.get` / `config.apply`
ASCOM actions over HTTP (the cross-driver protocol implemented in Phase 1; see
[`dsd-fp2.md`](dsd-fp2.md) "Config Actions").

## Naming and the `ui-*` family

This crate is the first member of a `ui-*` family of UI expressions. The naming
scheme distinguishes UI expressions along two axes — **technology** (for browser
targets) and **target** (for native):

| Crate | Target | Technology | Status |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|
| **`ui-htmx`** | browser | server-rendered HTMX | **this crate** |
| `ui-leptos` | browser | Leptos / WASM | future |
| `ui-ios` | iOS | native | future |
| `ui-android` | Android | native | future |
| `ui-core` | — | shared backend-for-frontend logic | extract when expression #2 lands |

A tech name (`htmx`, `leptos`) implies the browser target; a target name (`ios`,
`android`) implies native delivery. With HTMX the BFF and the frontend are
**fused** — the server renders the HTML directly — so `ui-htmx` is simultaneously
"the web BFF" and "the HTMX frontend". When a second expression appears, the
driver-client + config-model logic (target/tech-agnostic) is extracted into
`ui-core`; it would be premature with a single consumer today.

                  [ dsd-fp2 ]   (ASCOM Alpaca driver, port 11119)
```

Two thin, independently mockable seams keep the handlers testable without a live
driver (the pattern `sentinel` uses for its Alpaca polling — see
[`sentinel.md`](sentinel.md)):

- **`HttpClient`** (`io.rs`) — `get(url)` / `put_form(url, params)`. Production
  impl wraps `reqwest` and is built through `rp_tls::client::build_reqwest_client`
  so it trusts the Rusty Photon CA, with optional HTTP Basic auth. Requests send
  `Connection: close` (no keep-alive pooling): a driver applies config by
  reloading — tearing its server down and rebinding — which leaves a pooled
  connection stale, and a non-idempotent `PUT` is not retried. A fresh connection
  per request lets the reconnect poll recover the instant the driver is back;
  config actions are low-frequency, so the lost pooling is immaterial. Mocked
  with `mockall` for unit tests of the layer above.
- **`ConfigClient`** (`driver_client.rs`) — `get_config()` /
  `apply_config(Value)`. Knows the ASCOM action protocol: shapes the
  `PUT .../action` request, unwraps the Alpaca envelope, and parses the inner
  JSON. The page handlers depend on `Arc<dyn ConfigClient>`, so a handler unit
  test can inject a stub (via `AppState::with_client`) to cover an error state
  a live driver won't produce — see [Testing Strategy](#testing-strategy). The
  end-to-end BDD suite, by contrast, runs against a real driver, not a stub.

### The driver config-action client (wire contract)

Each driver exposes config over the standard ASCOM `Action` mechanism. The BFF
calls:

```
GET  /api/v1/{type}/{n}/supportedactions
   → Alpaca envelope, Value = ["config.get","config.apply", …]

PUT  /api/v1/{type}/{n}/action
       Action=config.get      Parameters=     ClientID=… ClientTransactionID=…
   → Alpaca envelope, Value = "<ConfigGetResponse as a JSON string>"

PUT  /api/v1/{type}/{n}/action
       Action=config.apply    Parameters=<full Config JSON>   ClientID=… …
   → Alpaca envelope, Value = "<ConfigApplyResponse as a JSON string>"
```

The **Alpaca envelope** wraps every response:

```jsonc
{ "Value": <result>, "ClientTransactionID": 0, "ServerTransactionID": 12,
  "ErrorNumber": 0, "ErrorMessage": "" }
```

`AlpacaConfigClient` parsing rules:

1. **HTTP non-2xx** → transport error (the driver's auth/TLS rejected us, or it is
   down). Rendered as a "driver unreachable / refused" banner.
2. **`ErrorNumber != 0`** → an ASCOM action error. `0x40C` (1036,
   `ACTION_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`) means the target is not a config-capable driver;
   surfaced as "this driver does not expose configuration". Other codes surface
   `ErrorMessage`.
3. **`ErrorNumber == 0`** → `Value` is a **JSON string**; parse it into the typed
   `ConfigGetResponse` / `ConfigApplyResponse`. (For `supportedactions`, `Value`
   is a JSON array, not a string.)

For `config.get` the inner body is `{ "config": <effective Config, secrets
redacted>, "overrides": ["serial.port"] }`. For `config.apply` it is the
classification body documented in [`dsd-fp2.md`](dsd-fp2.md) "config.apply"
(`status`, `applied`, `reload`, `restart_required`, `skipped_override`,
`persisted_to`, `errors`).

The config blob is treated as an **opaque `serde_json::Value`** by the transport
layer; only the hand-built page knows `dsd-fp2`'s field paths
(`serial.port`, `server.port`, `cover_calibrator.max_brightness`, …). This keeps
the BFF decoupled from the driver crate — it does **not** depend on `dsd-fp2` or
pull in its serial/transport dependencies.

## Routes (Phase 2)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET`  | `/` | Index: links to the configurable services (Phase 2: just `dsd-fp2`). |
| `GET`  | `/config/dsd-fp2` | Call `config.get`; render the hand-built form filled with current values. |
| `POST` | `/config/dsd-fp2` | Rebuild the full Config from the form, call `config.apply`; render the result state (see below). |
| `GET`  | `/config/dsd-fp2/status` | HTMX poll target during reconnect: try `config.get`; when the driver answers, swap in the refreshed form. |
| `GET`  | `/health` | Liveness; returns `OK`. |
| `GET`  | `/assets/app.css`, `/assets/htmx.min.js` | Embedded static assets (`include_str!`). |

### Form ⇆ Config mapping

The form edits a subset of fields; the rest must round-trip unchanged so
`config.apply` receives a complete `Config`. The page therefore carries the full
`config.get` blob (already secret-redacted) in a **hidden field**, and on POST:

1. Parse the hidden blob into a `serde_json::Value`.
2. Overlay each editable field onto it by JSON pointer (`/serial/port`,
   `/server/port`, `/cover_calibrator/max_brightness`, …).
3. Send the merged value as `Parameters` to `config.apply`.

This is the round-trip the protocol was designed for:

- **Override-pinned fields** (reported in `config.get`'s `overrides[]`) are
  rendered **read-only** with an explanation; the driver skips them on persist
  regardless (`skipped_override[]`), so even though the hidden blob carries the
  effective value, a transient `--port` is never baked into the file.
- **Redacted secrets** round-trip as the `********` sentinel; `config.apply`
  treats the sentinel as "leave unchanged", so a saved form never blanks a
  password hash.
- **Numeric fields are parsed into their bounded types** (`u16` ports, `u32`
  baud/brightness). An out-of-range or non-numeric value becomes a field-level
  error (re-rendered, not sent), rather than silently coercing to `0` or
  producing a non-field driver parse error. An empty *required* number keeps the
  prior value (clearing a port can't silently become OS-assigned); an empty
  *optional* number (`discovery_port`) persists `null`.
- **`cover_calibrator.enabled` is rendered read-only.** The driver registers the
  `covercalibrator/0` device — and therefore the `config.get` / `config.apply`
  actions, which live on it — only when `enabled` is true. Editing it to `false`
  from this page would tear down the very endpoint that could re-enable it (a
  self-lockout, recoverable only by a manual config-file edit + restart). The
  checkbox shows the current state but is disabled, and `merge_form` never
  overlays it, so neither the rendered form nor a forged POST can flip it.
  (Making config actions reachable while the device is disabled — a driver-side
  change — is tracked as follow-up; `server.port` edits have the same "the BFF
  loses the endpoint" property, deferred with the equipment roster.)

## Behavioral contracts

### Rendering the page (`GET /config/dsd-fp2`)

- **Happy path:** `config.get` succeeds → render the form filled with the
  effective config. Fields listed in `overrides[]` are disabled and annotated
  "pinned by a command-line override".
- **Driver unreachable / refused:** `HttpClient` transport error or HTTP non-2xx
  → render an error banner naming the driver URL, with a retry link. The form is
  not shown (there is nothing to edit).
- **Non-config driver:** `ErrorNumber == ACTION_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` → render an
  explanation that the target driver does not expose configuration actions.

### Applying changes (`POST /config/dsd-fp2`)

- **`status:"applying"`** (a field needed a reload): render a "Saved — the driver
  is reloading…" state that **polls** `GET /config/dsd-fp2/status` via
  `hx-trigger="every 1s"`. When the poll's `config.get` succeeds, swap the
  reconnecting fragment for the refreshed form plus a "reconnected" confirmation.
  This is the same brief blip a process restart would cause; the BFF treats it as
  expected (see the reload mechanics in the plan).
- **`status:"ok"`** (persisted, nothing needed a reload): render "Saved." with the
  refreshed form; no reconnect poll.
- **`status:"invalid"`** (validation failed, file unchanged): re-render the form
  with each `errors[]` entry shown next to its field (`path` → field), preserving
  the submitted values so the user can correct them in place.
- **Transport / ASCOM error:** same banners as the GET path.

### Reconnect poll (`GET /config/dsd-fp2/status`)

- `config.get` **succeeds** → 200 with the refreshed form fragment (HTMX swaps it
  in and the polling stops).
- `config.get` **fails** (driver still down mid-reload) → 200 with the same
  reconnecting fragment so HTMX keeps polling. The blip is normally well under a
  second; the poll is bounded only by the user leaving the page.

## Configuration

The BFF has its own small config (it is not an ASCOM device). Phase 2 hard-codes a
single driver target; later the device list is derived from `rp`'s equipment
roster or ASCOM discovery (see [Deferred](#deferred)).

```jsonc
{
  "server": {
    "bind": "127.0.0.1",   // BFF listen address
    "port": 11120          // BFF listen port
  },
  "drivers": {
    "dsd-fp2": {
      "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:11119",  // the driver's Alpaca base URL
      "device_type": "covercalibrator",
      "device_number": 0,
      "auth": null,            // optional { "username": "...", "password": "..." }
      "ca_cert_path": null     // optional PEM CA for a TLS-enabled driver
    }
  }
}
```

### CLI Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `-c, --config`     | Path to the BFF configuration file. If omitted, `Config::default()` is used (binds `127.0.0.1:11120`, targets `dsd-fp2` at `http://127.0.0.1:11119`). |
| `--port`           | BFF listen port (overrides `server.port`). |
| `-l, --log-level`  | Log level: trace, debug, info, warn, error. |

## Security

- **The BFF holds driver credentials**, in its own config, never in the page. It
  authenticates to a driver with HTTP Basic auth and trusts the Rusty Photon CA
  via `rp-tls` — the same client construction `sentinel` uses. Config actions are
  protected by whatever server-wide `rp-auth`/`rp-tls` the driver runs; the BFF is
  just an authorised client (see the plan's Security section).
- **Secrets are already redacted** by `config.get` (`********`), so they never
  reach the browser; the round-trip sentinel keeps them unchanged on apply.
- **Binds loopback by default; BFF-side TLS/auth is deferred.** The default
  config binds `127.0.0.1`, reachable only from the host (e.g. via an SSH tunnel
  from the warm-room laptop). Exposing the BFF on the LAN means binding `0.0.0.0`,
  which serves the config pages over **plain HTTP with no BFF-side auth** — so
  until BFF TLS/auth lands ([Deferred](#deferred)), reach it through an SSH tunnel
  or a reverse proxy that terminates TLS + auth, rather than a raw `0.0.0.0` bind.
  (The driver credentials the BFF holds are unaffected — the BFF is a client, and
  each driver still enforces its own `rp-auth`/`rp-tls`.)

## MVP Scope

### In Scope (Phase 2)

- A working `dsd-fp2` configuration page: `GET` renders the current config,
  `POST` applies edits via `config.apply`.
- Validation surfacing (`status:"invalid"` → field-level errors, values
  preserved).
- The applying/reconnecting flow (`status:"applying"` → HTMX poll until the driver
  is back).
- Override-pinned fields rendered read-only with an explanation.
- Driver-unreachable / non-config-driver error states.
- Dark theme reusing the mock CSS tokens; assets embedded via `include_str!`
  (CSS + the HTMX bundle); no npm, no WASM.
- Plain-axum lifecycle under `rusty-photon-service-lifecycle::ServiceRunner` with
  graceful shutdown; prints `bound_addr=<host>:<port>` on bind (for BDD port
  discovery).

### Deferred

- **Multi-driver / equipment roster.** Phase 2 targets a single hard-coded
  `dsd-fp2`. Deriving the device list from `rp`'s `GET /api/equipment` or ASCOM
  discovery is Phase 3/5.
- **Schema-driven forms.** Hand-built form first; a `config.schema`-driven
  renderer that generalises across drivers is Phase 3.
- **Live telemetry + the activity stream.** The SSE-driven stream UI
  (`7-stream-fold.html`) follows on a separate track once `rp` has a real-time
  event stream.
- **Sentinel `service.restart` affordance** and the `restart_required` escalation
  (Phase 4).
- **BFF-side TLS/auth**, the **LCARS theme**, and **i18n**.

## Testing Strategy

Follows [`docs/skills/testing.md`](../skills/testing.md).

### BDD Tests (Cucumber)

`config_page.feature` is the canonical contract for the page behaviour, and —
like every other service — it exercises the **real binaries end to end**. Each
scenario spawns the real `ui-htmx` process and a real `dsd-fp2` driver in mock
mode (via `bdd_infra::ServiceHandle`), points the BFF at the driver, and drives
the BFF over HTTP, asserting on the HTML it actually renders. There is no
in-process router and no stubbed `ConfigClient`: the production
`ReqwestHttpClient` → `AlpacaConfigClient` path and the driver's real
`config.get` / `config.apply` / in-process reload all run for real. The entry
point therefore uses `bdd_infra::bdd_main!` (child-process spawning, skipped
under Miri), and **both binaries must be pre-built with `--all-features`** (the
driver's mock transport is feature-gated):

```
cargo build --all-features --all-targets
cargo test  --all-features --test bdd -p ui-htmx
```

The driver is spawned on a fixed (not OS-assigned) port written into its config,
so its in-process reload rebinds the *same* port and the BFF can reconnect to it
(the override scenario additionally spawns the driver with `--port` via
`ServiceHandle::start_with_args`). Scenarios:

- The config page renders the driver's current configuration.
- A serial-port override is shown read-only with an explanation.
- A valid change is applied and the page reports the driver is reloading + polls
  `…/status`.
- The reloaded driver's new configuration is served back through the page —
  drives the real `config.apply` → reload → rebind → `config.get` round trip.
- An unchanged submission reports it was saved with no reload (`status:"ok"` —
  the only no-reload path, since the driver classifies *any* changed field as a
  reload).
- An invalid change re-renders the form with the driver's field-level error,
  the submitted value preserved.
- An unreachable driver surfaces an error banner.

### Unit Tests

- `driver_client.rs`: `AlpacaConfigClient` shapes the `PUT .../action` request
  (form fields, device path) and parses the Alpaca envelope — `Value`-as-JSON-
  string extraction for `config.get`/`config.apply`, `ErrorNumber != 0` →
  error, `ACTION_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` mapping, HTTP-non-2xx → transport error. Mocks
  `HttpClient`.
- `lib.rs`: the `config.get` handler renders the "this driver does not expose
  configuration" banner on `ACTION_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` — the one error state the
  end-to-end suite can't produce (the real `dsd-fp2` always implements the
  actions), driven in-process through `AppState::with_client` with a stub
  `ConfigClient`; plus `from_config` rejection of URL-embedded credentials.
- `pages`: form ⇆ Config reconstruction (hidden blob + editable overlay by JSON
  pointer; override-pinned not overlaid; redacted-secret sentinel round-trip).
- `config.rs`: defaults and JSON load.
- `io.rs`: `ReqwestHttpClient` connection-refused error path (mirrors sentinel).

## Module Structure
