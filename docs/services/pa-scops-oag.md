# Pegasus Astro Scops OAG Service

## Overview

The `pa-scops-oag` service is an ASCOM Alpaca Focuser driver for the
**Pegasus Astro Scops OAG** — a motorized off-axis guider whose stepper motor
focuses the guide camera. The motor is exposed as a standard absolute-position
ASCOM Focuser. The driver talks to the controller over its FTDI USB virtual
serial port using the Pegasus DMFC/Scops ASCII line protocol.

The Scops OAG is a standalone USB serial device (FTDI FT-X, USB id `0403:6015`).
It has **no temperature sensor**, so temperature and temperature-compensation
properties are reported as unsupported.

## Architecture

The service is built on `rusty-photon-shared-transport`. The shared crate owns
the refcount, slot, command-lock arbitration, poll-task lifetime, and the
reconnect supervisor; this service contributes the protocol-specific pieces:

- **Codec**: `ScopsCodec` translates `Command` ↔ LF-terminated ASCII frames and
  decodes incoming frames into a typed `ScopsResponse` by prefix. Every command
  produces exactly one response frame (no unsolicited frames), so
  `Codec::matches` only enforces command→response-shape pairing and
  `Codec::max_skip` keeps its default of 0. See `src/codec.rs`.
- **Transport factory**: `ScopsTransportFactory` opens a `tokio-serial` stream
  at 19200 8N1 and wraps it in a `SerialFrameTransport` with `b'\n'` as the
  frame terminator. See `src/serial.rs`.
- **Manager**: `FocuserManager` wraps `Arc<SharedTransport<ScopsCodec>>` plus the
  cached state. It constructs the `Hooks { handshake, on_last_disconnect,
  shutdown, while_open }` the shared transport runs across the connection
  lifecycle. The handshake verifies the `#` → `OK_SCOPS` identity and seeds the
  cache from one `A` status report; the `while_open` poll loop refreshes
  position + moving state from `A` on the configured interval. See `src/manager.rs`.
- **Protocol layer**: ASCII command serialization and the `A`-report parser
  (`src/protocol.rs`).
- **ASCOM device**: `ScopsFocuserDevice` holds an
  `Arc<RwLock<Option<Session<ScopsCodec>>>>` — the session existing **is** the
  "Connected" state. Implements `Device` + `Focuser` (`src/focuser_device.rs`).
- **Mock mode**: `MockScopsTransportFactory` implements `TransportFactory`
  directly and runs an in-memory Scops state machine. Feature-gated on `mock`
  for binaries, and `#[cfg(any(feature = "mock", test))]` so unit and BDD tests
  both drive the canonical mock. See `src/mock.rs`.
- **Server builder**: configures the factory, runs the eager startup handshake
  (`transport().start()`), and starts the ASCOM Alpaca server (`src/lib.rs`).

## Hardware Constraints

- **Connection**: USB FTDI FT-X virtual serial port (`/dev/ttyUSB*` on Linux, a
  COM port on Windows). USB id `0403:6015`, product string `Scops OAG`.
- **Serial settings**: **19200 baud, 8N1, no flow control.** This is the
  documented Pegasus DMFC rate and is required by this unit — empirically the
  device does **not** respond at 9600 (the only reply came at 19200). Baud is
  a config field defaulting to 19200.
- **Line terminator**: commands are terminated with LF (`\n`) only — **never**
  append `\r`. Responses are terminated with `\r\n`; the codec trims the
  trailing `\r`.
- **Stepper motor**, absolute position counter (unsigned integer ticks).
- **Position limit**: there is **no firmware max-position command**; the upper
  bound is software-enforced by the driver via `max_step`. The observed power-on
  position on the reference unit was `22000`; the true travel limit must be
  determined per device and `max_step` configured accordingly (default 100000).
- **No temperature sensor.** The `A` report carries a temperature *slot* for
  protocol compatibility with the DMFC family; on this unit it reads `0` and is
  ignored by the driver.
- **No usable reverse / backlash control.** The DMFC `N:` (reverse) and `C:`
  (backlash) set-commands are **rejected with `ERR:`** on Scops firmware 1.2, and
  ASCOM `IFocuserV4` has no reverse or backlash member, so the driver does not
  issue them. The reverse/encoder/backlash fields of the `A` report are read-only
  status and are not surfaced.

## Protocol Reference

ASCII commands over 19200-8N1 serial. Commands are LF-terminated; responses are
CRLF-terminated (the codec trims `\r`). Every command returns exactly one
response frame. Source command family: the Pegasus DMFC serial command table
and the INDI `pegasus_scopsoag` driver; the table below records what was
confirmed on the reference unit (firmware 1.2).

| Purpose | Command | Wire (sent) | Response | Moves motor |
|---------|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Identify / handshake | `Handshake` | `#\n` | `OK_SCOPS\r\n` | no |
| Status report (poll) | `Status` | `A\n` | `OK_SCOPS:<ver>:<motor>:<temp>:<pos>:<moving>:<led>:<rev>:<enc>:<backlash>\r\n` | no |
| Move to absolute position | `MoveAbsolute(pos)` | `M:<pos>\n` | `M:<pos>\r\n` (echo) | **yes** |
| Sync position (no move) | `SyncPosition(pos)` | `W:<pos>\n` | `W:<pos>\r\n` (echo) | no |
| Halt | `Halt` | `H\n` | `0\r\n` | yes |

### `A` status report fields

`OK_SCOPS:1.2:1:0:22000:0:1:0:1:0` decodes (10 colon-delimited fields) as:

| # | Field | Meaning | Driver use |
|---|-------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | status token | `OK_SCOPS` | identity check |
| 2 | firmware version | e.g. `1.2` | cached, surfaced in `driver_info`-adjacent logging |
| 3 | motor type | `1` = stepper | ignored |
| 4 | temperature | placeholder (`0` on this unit; no sensor) | ignored |
| 5 | position | absolute ticks (e.g. `22000`) | cached → ASCOM `Position` |
| 6 | is moving | `0` idle / `1` moving | cached → ASCOM `IsMoving` |
| 7 | LED | `0`/`1` | ignored |
| 8 | reverse | `0`/`1` | ignored (read-only) |
| 9 | encoder | `0`/`1` | ignored |
| 10 | backlash | steps (`0` = off) | ignored (read-only) |

Commands not issued by this driver: `M:`/`W:` are sent in the clean Pegasus form
without the trailing `d` byte that the INDI driver's `snprintf("%ud")` emits;
the firmware tolerates the trailing `d` but the manufacturer form is canonical.
`N:` (reverse) and `C:` (backlash) are intentionally never sent — the device
rejects them and ASCOM has no matching property.

## ASCOM Focuser Mapping

| ASCOM Property/Method | Implementation |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Absolute | `true` (always) |
| Position | Cached from `A` polling (i64 → i32 cast); `INVALID_OPERATION` until first poll |
| IsMoving | Cached from `A` field 6; force-refreshed via `A` when a move is in flight |
| MaxStep | From config `max_step` |
| MaxIncrement | From config `max_step` (a single absolute move can span full travel) |
| Move | Validates `0..=max_step`, sends `M:<pos>` |
| Halt | Sends `H` |
| StepSize | `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` (no microns/step figure for the OAG focuser) |
| TempComp | `false` |
| TempCompAvailable | `false` |
| Temperature | `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` (no sensor) |
| InterfaceVersion | `4` |

The single substantive divergence from `qhy-focuser` is `Temperature`: the
Scops OAG has no probe, so it returns `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` rather than a value, and
`TempCompAvailable`/`TempComp` are `false` — a self-consistent "no temperature
compensation" profile ConformU accepts.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "serial": {
    "port": "/dev/ttyUSB0",
    "baud_rate": 19200,
    "polling_interval": "1s",
    "timeout": "2s"
  },
  "server": {
    "port": 11123
  },
  "focuser": {
    "name": "Pegasus Scops OAG",
    "unique_id": "",
    "description": "Pegasus Astro Scops OAG motorized off-axis guider focuser",
    "enabled": true,
    "max_step": 100000
  }
}
```

`unique_id` is optional and may be omitted or left empty: the service mints a
UUIDv4 on first run and persists it (see [Device identity](#device-identity-uniqueid)).
`max_step` defaults to `100000`; tune it down to the OAG's actual travel limit
once known (the reference unit powered on at position `22000`, so the limit is at
least that).

### Device identity (UniqueID)

The focuser's ASCOM `UniqueID` is **minted on first run** rather than shipped as
a hardcoded literal. On startup the service resolves the config path (the
`--config` path if given, otherwise the per-user platform config dir — e.g.
`~/.config/rusty-photon/pa-scops-oag.json` on Linux) and calls
`rusty_photon_config::materialize_identity` with the JSON pointer
`/focuser/unique_id`. That helper mints a spec-compliant UUIDv4 if the id is
absent/empty, never overwrites a non-empty id, writes the default scaffold if the
file is absent, and persists atomically (the on-disk file only — a transient
`--port`/`--server-port` override is never baked in).

### CLI Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `-c, --config` | Path to configuration file |
| `--port` | Serial port path (overrides config) |
| `--server-port` | Server port (overrides config) |
| `-l, --log-level` | Log level: trace, debug, info, warn, error |

### Config actions

The focuser exposes its configuration over HTTP as the vendor ASCOM actions
`config.get` / `config.apply` / `config.schema`, the cross-driver protocol
documented in [`config-actions.md`](config-actions.md) and implemented
generically in `rusty_photon_config::actions`. `config_actions.rs` supplies only
the driver-specific half via `ConfigurableDriver for ScopsFocuserDriver`:

- **Secrets redacted on read / carried forward on apply:** `/server/auth/password_hash`.
- **Locked (identity) field:** `focuser.unique_id` — the driver owns and mints it.
- **Hard read-only fields:** `server.port` (the BFF cannot follow a port rebind)
  and `focuser.enabled` (disabling tears down the device the actions live on).
- **CLI-override-pinned fields:** `serial.port` (`--port`) and `server.port`
  (`--server-port`) are reported in `config.get`'s `overrides[]` and never
  persisted by `config.apply`.

A `config.apply` that changes any field persists atomically, returns
`status:"applying"`, and fires the in-process reload (`main.rs` runs under
`ServiceRunner::with_reload().run_with_reload(...)`): the loop tears the old
server down — draining HTTP and releasing the serial port — and rebuilds from the
freshly-persisted file, rebinding the same port.

## Module Structure

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `codec.rs` | `ScopsCodec` (frame ↔ typed response) + error mapping |
| `config.rs` | Configuration types, loading, `CliOverrides`, `load_effective_config` |
| `config_actions.rs` | `ConfigurableDriver` impl: validation, secrets, editability tiers |
| `error.rs` | `ScopsOagError` via `rusty_photon_driver::driver_error!` |
| `focuser_device.rs` | ASCOM Device + Focuser trait implementation; config-action dispatch |
| `lib.rs` | Module declarations, ServerBuilder (config source + reload signal) |
| `main.rs` | CLI entry point; `run_with_reload` loop owned by `rusty-photon-service-lifecycle::ServiceRunner` |
| `manager.rs` | `FocuserManager` + handshake / poll-loop hooks |
| `mock.rs` | Mock transport (feature-gated for binaries; always on under `cfg(test)`) |
| `protocol.rs` | ASCII command serialization + `A`-report parser |
| `serial.rs` | `ScopsTransportFactory` over tokio-serial |

## Connection Lifecycle

The service runs in `ServiceLifetime` mode: `ServerBuilder::build()` calls
`transport().start()` so the port is opened, the handshake runs, and the poll
task spawns **before** the HTTP listener binds (eager hardware validation — a
handshake failure exits the process non-zero rather than advertising a broken
device).

1. `ServerBuilder::build()` runs `transport().start()`:
   - opens the serial port via `ScopsTransportFactory`,
   - handshake hook: `#` → verify `OK_SCOPS`, then `A` → seed cache (position,
     is_moving, firmware),
   - spawns the `while_open` poll task (issues `A` on the configured interval).
2. ASCOM client calls `set_connected(true)` → the device `acquire()`s a session
   (fast refcount-bump; the port is already open).
3. Background polling refreshes position + is_moving from `A`.
4. Move: `move_(pos)` validates `0..=max_step`, sets cache `is_moving = true`
   optimistically, sends `M:<pos>`. The next poll (or a force-refresh from
   `is_moving()`) updates `is_moving`/position from the device's `A` report.
5. Halt: `halt()` sends `H` and clears the cached move state.
6. On `set_connected(false)` the session is released (refcount-bump down; the
   port stays open in `ServiceLifetime` mode). On process shutdown,
   `transport().shutdown()` cancels the poll task and closes the port.

**Failure recovery.** Mid-stream transport errors flip the shared transport into
the `Reconnecting` state and the supervisor re-opens + re-handshakes; live
sessions resume on the new connection on their next request.

## Testing

- **Unit tests** (`#[cfg(test)]` in `src/`): command serialization, `A`-report
  parsing (happy path + every error variant), codec encode/decode/matches,
  config defaults + `config_actions` validation, error conversions, and manager
  behaviour driven through the mock transport factory. Race / refcount /
  rollback / while-open lifecycle invariants are tested once for everyone in
  `rusty-photon-shared-transport`'s own suite — not duplicated here.
- **BDD tests** (cucumber-rs): connection lifecycle, device metadata, movement
  control, focuser readings, background polling, config actions, auth, TLS — all
  driving the spawned `--features mock` binary over the typed Alpaca client.
- **Server tests** (`test_lib.rs`, feature-gated `mock`): server startup +
  device registration.
- **ConformU** (`conformu_integration.rs`, feature-gated `conformu`): ASCOM
  Alpaca Focuser compliance against the mock binary.

```bash
cargo test -p pa-scops-oag --features mock
cargo test -p pa-scops-oag --test bdd --features mock
cargo test -p pa-scops-oag --features conformu --test conformu_integration -- --ignored
cargo run  -p pa-scops-oag --features mock
```

## MVP scope

**In scope:** absolute Move, Halt, Position, IsMoving, the connection lifecycle,
config actions, auth, and TLS — the full ASCOM `IFocuserV4` surface the Scops
OAG can back.

**Deferred / out of scope:** reverse and backlash control (rejected by the
firmware and absent from `IFocuserV4`); temperature and temperature compensation
(no sensor); LED, encoder, and motor-speed controls (not part of the Focuser
contract). The `A` report's status-only fields for these are read but not
surfaced.
