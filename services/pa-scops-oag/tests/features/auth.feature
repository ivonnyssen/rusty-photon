  Scenario: auth enabled with correct credentials returns 200
    Given generated TLS certificates for pa-scops-oag
    And pa-scops-oag is configured with TLS and auth enabled and mock serial
    When pa-scops-oag is started with TLS and auth
    Then the Alpaca management endpoint should respond with valid credentials

  Scenario: auth enabled with wrong credentials returns 401
    Given generated TLS certificates for pa-scops-oag
    And pa-scops-oag is configured with TLS and auth enabled and mock serial
    When pa-scops-oag is started with TLS and auth
    Then the Alpaca management endpoint should reject wrong credentials with 401

  Scenario: auth enabled with missing credentials returns 401
    Given generated TLS certificates for pa-scops-oag
    And pa-scops-oag is configured with TLS and auth enabled and mock serial

    Then the Alpaca management endpoint should reject missing credentials with 401

  Scenario: 401 response includes WWW-Authenticate header
    Given generated TLS certificates for pa-scops-oag
    And pa-scops-oag is configured with TLS and auth enabled and mock serial
    When pa-scops-oag is started with TLS and auth
