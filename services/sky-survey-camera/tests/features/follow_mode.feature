Feature: Telescope-following pointing mode (F1, F2, F5, F6, F7, F8)

  When `pointing.telescope` is configured, every `StartExposure`
  reads RA/Dec from the configured ASCOM Telescope (with an
  optional configurable arcsec offset) and uses that as the
  exposure's pointing snapshot. Static-mode contracts P1–P7 are
  unchanged when `pointing.telescope` is absent — those scenarios
  live in `pointing_api.feature`.

  In follow mode, `POST /sky-survey/position` arms a one-shot
  pointing override (F6 + F7) consumed by the next light exposure;
  subsequent exposures resume reading the mount. This is a test
  affordance for injecting "the camera saw something different from
  where the mount thinks it is" on a single capture.

  When `pointing.rotator` is also configured, each light exposure
  additionally reads `position` from the ASCOM Rotator and uses it
  as the snapshot's rotation (F8); without it, rotation stays at the
  static `initial_rotation_deg`.

  Scenario: F1/F4 — each exposure reads the mount fresh
    Given a mount reports RA 10.0 hours and Dec 30.0 degrees
    And the camera is configured to follow that mount
    And the camera is started and connected in follow mode
    Then after a successful exposure, the position endpoint reports RA approximately 150.0 Dec approximately 30.0
    When the mount is updated to RA 6.0 hours and Dec -45.0 degrees
    Then after another successful exposure, the position endpoint reports RA approximately 90.0 Dec approximately -45.0

  Scenario: F2 — mount read failure surfaces as an exposure error
    Given a mount that errors on every read
    And the camera is configured to follow that mount
    And the camera is started and connected in follow mode
    When I StartExposure with default parameters
    Then the exposure fails with ASCOM UNSPECIFIED_ERROR

  Scenario: F5a — RA offset shifts the snapshot east-west
    Given a mount reports RA 10.0 hours and Dec 30.0 degrees
    And the camera is configured to follow that mount with offset RA 3600 arcsec and Dec 0 arcsec
    And the camera is started and connected in follow mode
    Then after a successful exposure, the position endpoint reports RA approximately 151.0 Dec approximately 30.0

  Scenario: F5b — Dec offset shifts the snapshot north-south
    Given a mount reports RA 10.0 hours and Dec 30.0 degrees
    And the camera is configured to follow that mount with offset RA 0 arcsec and Dec -3600 arcsec
    And the camera is started and connected in follow mode
    Then after a successful exposure, the position endpoint reports RA approximately 150.0 Dec approximately 29.0

  Scenario: F6/F7 — POST in follow mode arms a one-shot pointing override
    Given a mount reports RA 10.0 hours and Dec 30.0 degrees
    And the camera is configured to follow that mount
    And the camera is started and connected in follow mode
    When I POST RA 1 Dec 2 to the position endpoint
    Then the response status is 204
    Then after a successful exposure, the position endpoint reports RA approximately 1.0 Dec approximately 2.0
    Then after another successful exposure, the position endpoint reports RA approximately 150.0 Dec approximately 30.0

  Scenario: F8 — the rotator's position angle drives the exposure rotation
    Given a mount reports RA 10.0 hours and Dec 30.0 degrees
    And a rotator reports position angle 42.0 degrees
    And the camera is configured to follow that mount
    And the camera is started and connected in follow mode
    Then after a successful exposure, the position endpoint reports RA approximately 150.0 Dec approximately 30.0 and rotation approximately 42.0
