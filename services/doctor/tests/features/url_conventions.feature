Feature: URL convention diagnosis
  The Alpaca client in this stack — rp's equipment[*].alpaca_url — appends
  /api/v1 itself, so a configured URL must NOT carry it: a doubled prefix
  resolves nothing and 404s every request while leaving the config file
  individually valid. Only a cross-convention check catches it; it is a
  warning because a deliberate reverse proxy could legitimately rewrite
  paths. (Sentinel's URLs are all derived since D3s, and ui-htmx's device
  URLs come from rp's roster since #569 — no other client-side convention
  is left to check.)

  Background:
    Given platform facts with enabled units:
      | unit                     |
      | rusty-photon-sentinel    |
      | rusty-photon-rp          |
      | rusty-photon-ui-htmx     |
      | rusty-photon-qhy-focuser |

  Scenario: An rp equipment alpaca_url carrying /api/v1 warns
    Given a config directory with "rp.json" containing:
      """
      { "server": { "port": 11115 },
        "equipment": {
          "cameras": [ { "alpaca_url": "http://localhost:11121/api/v1" } ] } }
      """
    When I run doctor with --json
    Then the report contains a "warn" check named "urls.spurious-suffix" for service "rp"

  Scenario: Suffix-free client URLs pass
    Given a config directory with "rp.json" containing:
      """
      { "server": { "port": 11115 },
        "equipment": {
          "cameras": [ { "alpaca_url": "http://localhost:11121" } ] } }
      """
    When I run doctor with --json
    Then the report has no checks named "urls.spurious-suffix" with status "warn"
