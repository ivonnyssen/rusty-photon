Feature: End-to-end safety monitoring
  Sentinel polls a real ASCOM Alpaca SafetyMonitor (filemonitor),
  detects state changes, and records transitions in the dashboard API.

  Scenario: Sentinel detects safe state from filemonitor
    Given a monitoring file containing "OPEN"
    And filemonitor is running with a contains rule "OPEN" as safe
    And sentinel is configured to monitor the filemonitor
    And sentinel is running
    When I wait for sentinel to poll
    Then the dashboard status should show "Safe" for "Roof Monitor"

  Scenario: Sentinel detects unsafe state from filemonitor
    Given a monitoring file containing "CLOSED"
    And filemonitor is running with a contains rule "OPEN" as safe
    And sentinel is configured to monitor the filemonitor
    And sentinel is running
    When I wait for sentinel to poll
    Then the dashboard status should show "Unsafe" for "Roof Monitor"

  Scenario: Sentinel detects state transition after file change
    Given a monitoring file containing "OPEN"
    And filemonitor is running with a contains rule "OPEN" as safe and 1 second polling
    And sentinel is configured to monitor the filemonitor with 1 second polling
    And sentinel is running
    When I wait for sentinel to poll
    Then the dashboard status should show "Safe" for "Roof Monitor"
    When the monitoring file changes to "CLOSED"
    And I wait for the state to change
    Then the dashboard status should show "Unsafe" for "Roof Monitor"

  Scenario: State transition is recorded in notification history
    Given a monitoring file containing "OPEN"
    And filemonitor is running with a contains rule "OPEN" as safe and 1 second polling
    And sentinel is configured to monitor the filemonitor with 1 second polling
    And a safe-to-unsafe transition rule for "Roof Monitor"
    And sentinel is running
    When I wait for sentinel to poll
    And the monitoring file changes to "CLOSED"
    And I wait for the state to change
    Then the dashboard history should contain a record for "Roof Monitor"
    And the history record message should contain "Unsafe"

  Scenario: Sentinel shows unknown when device is unreachable
    Given sentinel is configured to monitor a device at an unreachable address
    And sentinel is running
    When I wait for sentinel to poll
    Then the dashboard status should show "Unknown" for "Unreachable Monitor"
