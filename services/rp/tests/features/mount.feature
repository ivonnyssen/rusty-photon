Feature: Mount tools
  rp exposes Telescope (mount) device operations as MCP tools. The
  mount is singular per rp deployment — piggyback rigs share one
  mount across multiple optical trains, so the slew / sync_mount /
  get_mount_position / get_tracking / set_tracking tools take no
  mount_id parameter.

  slew drives the mount to absolute equatorial coordinates and blocks
  until Slewing == false plus the configured / per-call settle. ASCOM
  requires Tracking == true before equatorial slews — slew propagates
  the natural Alpaca error if tracking is off rather than auto-enabling.
  Callers manage tracking explicitly via set_tracking / get_tracking.

  sync_mount sets the mount's reported position immediately, no polling.
  get_mount_position returns the mount's current RA (hours) / Dec
  (degrees). get_tracking returns both the current tracking state and
  the CanSetTracking capability; it fails loud if the Tracking read
  errors (no half-success).

  Scenario: Tool catalog includes Mount tools
    Given a running Alpaca simulator
    And rp is running with a mount on the simulator
    And an MCP client connected to rp
    When the MCP client lists available tools
    Then the tool list should include "slew"
    And the tool list should include "sync_mount"
    And the tool list should include "get_mount_position"
    And the tool list should include "get_tracking"
    And the tool list should include "set_tracking"
    And the tool list should include "park"
    And the tool list should include "unpark"
    And the tool list should include "get_park_state"
    And the tool list should include "abort_slew"

  Scenario: slew drives the mount to absolute equatorial coordinates
    Given a running Alpaca simulator
    And rp is running with a mount on the simulator
    And an MCP client connected to rp
    And the mount is unparked
    And the mount tracking is set to true
    When the MCP client calls "slew" with ra "10.6847" dec "41.2689"
    Then the tool call should succeed
    And the slew result actual_ra should be 10.6847
    And the slew result actual_dec should be 41.2689

  Scenario: slew with tracking off returns an error
    Given a running Alpaca simulator

  Scenario: slew with mount not connected returns an error
    Given rp is running with a mount at "http://localhost:1" device 0
    And an MCP client connected to rp
    When the MCP client calls "slew" with ra "0.0" dec "0.0"

      | 0.0     | 91.0    | dec out of range               |
      | MISSING | 0.0     | missing required parameter: ra |
      | 0.0     | MISSING | missing required parameter: dec|

  Scenario: sync_mount sets the mount's reported position
    Given a running Alpaca simulator
    And rp is running with a mount on the simulator
    And an MCP client connected to rp
    When the MCP client calls "sync_mount" with ra "5.0" dec "10.0"

  # Pin at_park == false explicitly: earlier scenarios in this
  # feature park the singleton OmniSim mount, so we can't assume the
  # default. The bare `park` call would still succeed if invoked while
  # already at_park == true, but pre-parking masks the actual park
  # transition this scenario is meant to exercise.

    And the error message should contain "no mount configured"

  # `the mount is unparked` Given enables tracking before the
  # scenario's first park — without it, OmniSim's slew loop wouldn't
  # advance the park slew (tracking gets cleared by ASCOM after the
  # previous park scenario), and the When step would deadline out.
  Scenario: unpark clears the mount's parked flag
    Given a running Alpaca simulator
    And rp is running with a mount on the simulator

    Then the tool call should succeed
    When the MCP client calls "get_park_state"

    And the get_park_state result at_park should be false

  # Unparks first to pin a deterministic at_park == false starting
  # state — earlier scenarios in this feature park the singleton
  # OmniSim mount, so the round-trip-from-default assumption can't
  # hold without an explicit reset.
  Scenario: get_park_state returns at_park, can_park, and can_unpark
    Given a running Alpaca simulator
