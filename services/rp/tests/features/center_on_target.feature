Feature: Center on target compound tool
  The center_on_target MCP tool drives an iterative
  capture → plate_solve → sync_mount → slew loop until the great-circle
  residual between the solved field-center and the requested (ra, dec)
  sits at or below tolerance_arcsec. ra is decimal hours [0, 24); dec is
  decimal degrees [-90, 90]; the input is converted to degrees once for
  the residual check (the solved values are degrees on the wire). On the
  first iteration the tool issues sync_mount with the solved center
  unconditionally — the first solve is the absolute pointing reference
  and subsequent iterations rely on the mount honouring relative slews
  rather than re-syncing. After sync, if the residual is already inside
  tolerance the loop returns without slewing; otherwise it slews to
  (ra, dec) and continues. Subsequent iterations skip the sync, slew on
  miss, and return on hit. The loop errors with tolerance_not_reached
  after max_attempts and propagates any per-iteration capture /
  plate_solve / sync_mount / slew failure verbatim. center_on_target
  does not write a section on any single exposure document — each
  per-iteration capture's wcs section is written by the embedded
  plate_solve, and the compound result is returned via MCP plus
  centering_started / centering_iteration / centering_complete events.
  Inputs (camera_id, ra, dec, duration, tolerance_arcsec, max_attempts)
  are required; max_attempts is capped at 50 (MAX_ATTEMPTS) before any
  motion. The mount is resolved via the singular mount config — there is
  no telescope_id parameter.

  Scenario: Tool catalog includes center_on_target
    Given a running Alpaca simulator
    And a stub plate solver returning a canned WCS
    And rp is running with a camera and a mount on the simulator
    And the mount tracking is set to true
    And an MCP client connected to rp
    When the MCP client lists available tools
    Then the tool list should include "center_on_target"

  Scenario: Single-iteration happy path returns converged immediately
    Given a running Alpaca simulator
    And a stub plate solver returning a canned WCS
    And rp is running with a camera and a mount on the simulator
    And the mount tracking is set to true
    And an MCP client connected to rp
    When the MCP client calls "sync_mount" with ra "0.7123" dec "41.269"
    And the MCP client calls center_on_target with camera "main-cam" ra 0.7123 dec 41.269 duration "100ms" tolerance_arcsec 60 max_attempts 5
    Then the tool call should succeed
    And the center_on_target result should report attempts 1
    And the center_on_target iterations[0] action should be "converged"
    And the center_on_target result should contain "final_ra"
    And the center_on_target result should contain "final_dec"
    And the center_on_target result should contain "final_error_arcsec"

  # Canned WCS values are kept within ~2 arcmin of the input target
  # so the iter-1 sync teleports the mount only a tiny distance and
  # the subsequent slew completes well within do_slew_blocking's
  # 300 s deadline (and rmcp's 300 s keep-alive). Earlier values
  # ~9° off target reliably hung windows / bdd / rp under CI load
  # — see issue tracker for the OmniSim slew-time investigation.

    Given a running Alpaca simulator
    And a stub plate solver returning these per-call WCS responses:
      | ra_center | dec_center |

      | 10.6845   | 41.269     |
    And rp is running with a camera and a mount on the simulator

    And the center_on_target iterations[1] action should be "converged"

  Scenario: tolerance_not_reached after max_attempts
    Given a running Alpaca simulator
    And a stub plate solver returning a canned WCS
    And rp is running with a camera and a mount on the simulator
    And the mount tracking is set to true
    And an MCP client connected to rp
    # Default canned WCS is (10.6848°, 41.269°). Target is ~3.6"
    # off in dec — bigger than the 1" tolerance, so iter 1 + iter 2
    # both miss → tolerance_not_reached. Slew distance per iter is
    # ~3.6" (tiny) so this can't hang under any plausible OmniSim
    # timing.
    When the MCP client calls "sync_mount" with ra "0.7123" dec "41.270"
    And the MCP client calls center_on_target with camera "main-cam" ra 0.7123 dec 41.270 duration "100ms" tolerance_arcsec 1 max_attempts 2

    And the error message should contain "solve_failed"

  Scenario: Mid-loop equipment failure (tracking off) aborts and propagates
    Given a running Alpaca simulator
    And a stub plate solver returning a canned WCS
    And rp is running with a camera and a mount on the simulator
    And the mount tracking is set to false
    And an MCP client connected to rp
    # ASCOM requires Tracking == true before equatorial sync_mount
    # and slew operations — the iter-1 sync_mount propagates the
    # natural Alpaca error if tracking is off, aborting the loop.
    # We assert the propagated error fragment from do_sync_mount
    # ("failed to sync mount") so the scenario fails loud if the
    # abort point ever moves to a different inner call (capture,
    # plate_solve, slew). Target is kept close to the canned WCS
    # for defense-in-depth — even if the impl ever stopped
    # requiring tracking for sync, the subsequent slew would still
    # be tiny.
    When the MCP client calls center_on_target with camera "main-cam" ra 0.7123 dec 41.270 duration "100ms" tolerance_arcsec 1 max_attempts 5

    And rp is running with a camera and a mount on the simulator
    And the mount tracking is set to true
    And an MCP client connected to rp
    # Sync-on-iter-1-only invariant: iter 1 records "sync" (sync +
    # slew), iter 2 records "slew" (no sync), iter 3 records
    # "converged". The strong invariant — that sync_to is invoked
    # exactly once across the whole loop — is verified by the
    # synthetic-mount unit test in `imaging::tools::center_on_target`
    # which counts adapter calls directly. This BDD scenario
    # validates the user-visible action sequence and exercises the
    # live OmniSim mount through a multi-iter sync/slew/converged
    # cycle.
