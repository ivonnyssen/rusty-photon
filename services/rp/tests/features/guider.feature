Feature: Guider MCP tools
  The guiding tools (start_guiding, stop_guiding, dither, pause_guiding,
  resume_guiding, get_guiding_stats) proxy to the guider rp-managed
  service over HTTP. All quantities are guide-camera pixels. The
  guider is configured at equipment.mount.guiding — guiding is
  mount-scoped, so the block cannot exist without a mount. Settle
  parameters merge field by field: a per-call value wins over the
  guiding block's settle_* config default, and a field unset in both
  is omitted from the wire so the service's own settling config
  applies. The dither amount falls back from the pixels parameter to
  the guiding block's dither_pixels. dither's optional unit
  (guide_px default, main_px, arcsec) interprets the per-call pixels
  amount; rp converts to guide-camera pixels before the proxy call
  using the train pixel-scale derivation 206.265 x pixel_size_x_um /
  focal_length_mm (guiding train's scale for arcsec; main_px
  additionally needs exactly one imaging train). A non-default unit
  requires an explicit per-call pixels amount — the dither_pixels
  config default is always guide-camera pixels — and the error names
  whichever conversion input is missing. The settle-blocking calls emit
  operation triples ending in settled
  (guide_started/guide_settled/guide_failed,
  dither_started/dither_settled/dither_failed), with the settle
  deadline carried on the started envelope when a settle timeout is
  known; stop_guiding emits the guide_stopped point event with reason
  "requested". Without a guiding block every tool errors with "guider
  not configured"; service errors propagate as code plus message.
