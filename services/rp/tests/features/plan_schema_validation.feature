Feature: Plan schema and validation tools
  The plan-data analogue of the config.get / config.schema / config.apply
  protocol (ADR-019, rp.md § Plan schema and validation): two read-only
  MCP tools that let any surface discover the shape of plan data and check
  a candidate against the same rules the write tools enforce, without
  writing anything.

  `get_plan_schema` returns the JSON Schema for one plan-data entity,
  generated from the same types the write tools deserialize.
  `validate_plan` checks a candidate value and returns
  `{valid, errors: [{path, msg}]}` — the identical FieldError shape
  config-actions returns, so a surface renders a plan error next to its
  field with the code it already has for driver config. Paths are dotted
  and indexed into the submitted value ("ra_hours",
  "goals[1].binning", "scheduling.min_altitude_degrees").

  `entity` is one of "target" (the add_target payload), "goals" (a goals
  array), or "naming_pattern" ({file_naming_pattern, directory_pattern}).

  These tools exist only if they cannot disagree with the writers, so
  they re-implement nothing: validate_plan and add_target call the same
  functions in rp's plan_validation module. The scenarios below pin that
  agreement in both directions rather than leaving it to convention.

  Both tools are MCP-only and read-only: no REST counterpart, no store
  write, no actuation.

  Scenario: get_plan_schema returns a JSON Schema for the target entity
    Given rp is running with a target store
    And an MCP client connected to rp
    When the MCP client calls "get_plan_schema" for entity "target"
    Then the tool call should succeed
    And the returned schema should describe properties "display_name, ra_hours, dec_degrees, goals"

  Scenario: get_plan_schema covers every validatable entity
    Given rp is running with a target store
    And an MCP client connected to rp
    When the MCP client calls "get_plan_schema" for entity "goals"
    Then the tool call should succeed
    When the MCP client calls "get_plan_schema" for entity "naming_pattern"
    Then the tool call should succeed

  Scenario: An unknown entity is rejected rather than silently answered
    Given rp is running with a target store
    And an MCP client connected to rp
    When the MCP client calls "get_plan_schema" for entity "telescope"
    Then the tool call should return an error
    And the error message should contain "telescope"

  Scenario: A well-formed target payload validates clean
    Given rp is running with a target store and filter roster "Red, Blue"
    And an MCP client connected to rp
    When the MCP client validates entity "target" with value:
