Feature: Real-browser behavior
  These scenarios drive a real headless Firefox via WebDriver to prove the one
  thing the server-output layers cannot: that the vendored htmx.min.js actually
  loads and executes the declared swaps in a browser engine (obligation P3).
  They are advisory and gated behind UI_BROWSER_TESTS=1, and run on a single
  environment — the server-bytes layers (P1 correctness, P2 OS-invariance) carry
  the cross-OS guarantee, so behavior proven correct here holds on every OS
  without a browser on every OS.

  Scenario: The configuration form renders in a real browser
    Given a dsd-fp2 driver running with serial.port "/dev/ttyACM0" and max_brightness 4096
    When I load the dsd-fp2 config page in a browser
    Then the browser renders the configuration form

  Scenario: Unlocking the identity field swaps the card via htmx
    Given a dsd-fp2 driver running with serial.port "/dev/ttyACM0" and max_brightness 4096
    When I load the dsd-fp2 config page in a browser
    And I click the unlock link for cover_calibrator.unique_id
    Then the browser shows cover_calibrator.unique_id editable

  # Tier 0 step 3 (plan §9): quitting the browser before stopping the BFF lets the
  # BFF shut down gracefully, so it runs its atexit handler and flushes coverage.
  # Reversing the order would block the BFF on the browser's held connection until
  # the 5s SIGKILL grace and silently zero its BDD coverage (testing.md §5.4).
  Scenario: The BFF flushes coverage on graceful shutdown with a browser attached
    Given a dsd-fp2 driver running with serial.port "/dev/ttyACM0" and max_brightness 4096
    When I load the dsd-fp2 config page in a browser
    And I quit the browser and then stop the BFF
    Then the BFF shuts down gracefully before the 5s SIGKILL grace elapses

  # Tier 0 step 4 (plan §9): the worst case — geckodriver dies without telling
  # Firefox to quit (a panic/timeout, or the Firefox<152 SIGTERM bug). The
  # kill-the-tree reaper (killpg of geckodriver's process group) must still leave
  # zero orphans, and failure-triage artifacts must land at an absolute path first.
  # Linux-only: the orphan scan reads /proc. Like the rest of @browser it runs on
  # Linux CI + dev; macOS/Windows browser support is plan §9 step 5 (deferred), and
  # forcing UI_BROWSER_TESTS=1 there fails loud rather than silently passing.
  Scenario: A crashed browser session is reaped with no orphaned processes
    Given a dsd-fp2 driver running with serial.port "/dev/ttyACM0" and max_brightness 4096
    When I load the dsd-fp2 config page in a browser
    And the geckodriver process is killed and the session is reaped
    Then the reaper leaves no orphaned browser processes
    And the failure artifacts were captured at an absolute path before the reap
