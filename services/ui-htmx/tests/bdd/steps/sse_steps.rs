//! Step definitions for sse.feature (`@browser`) — Layer C / P3, plan §9 Tier 2.
//!
//! These drive the test-only `/fixtures/sse` routes (present only in a
//! `test-sse`-feature binary) to prove the browser harness observes async
//! server-pushed DOM updates over a live Server-Sent-Events stream — and that an
//! open SSE stream still permits a graceful, coverage-flushing BFF shutdown when
//! the browser is quit first.
//!
//! Almost every verb is reused: the BFF-up `Given` and the fixture-load /
//! region-shows steps come from [`super::fixtures_steps`]; the quit-then-stop
//! `When` and the graceful-shutdown `Then` come from [`super::browser_steps`]
//! (the same coverage invariant, now with an SSE connection held open). Only the
//! stream-pushed precondition below is new — it belongs in `When`-space (it gates
//! the teardown, it is not the scenario's outcome), so it cannot reuse the
//! `Then`-registered region-shows step.
