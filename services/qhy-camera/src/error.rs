//! Startup / library error type for the qhy-camera service.
//!
//! This is the *lib/startup* error returned to `main` (SDK open, enumeration,
//! HTTP bind). It is deliberately distinct from the per-request ASCOM error
//! mapping: that happens at the `Device`/`Camera`/`FilterWheel` trait boundary
//! (each call site picks the right `ASCOMError`), exactly as the reference
//! `qhyccd-alpaca` driver and `sky-survey-camera` do.
